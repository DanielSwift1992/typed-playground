// an extension whose owner is missing, a body without its builder attribute, an
// import of a module the package never names, a top alias naming nothing — so
// the page states these itself, in the compiler's place.
//
// One implementation, two readers: the page draws them as cards while you type,
// and check.js runs them over every world, so a guard that fires in the browser
// is a red vector in CI and never again a thing only an eye can catch.

// The three modules a world may name: the theory, the drawing kit, and the
// domain the company tabs are written against. Each world is a target of the
// package beside this page, so what the guard admits is what `swift build` reads.
